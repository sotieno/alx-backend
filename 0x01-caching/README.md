# Caching

Caching is a potent technique that greatly enhances system performance by storing frequently accessed data in memory, reducing database queries, and improving response times. This repository contains a collection of mini-projects that explore different caching strategies. Each project is thoughtfully designed to be both straightforward and challenging, offering valuable hands-on experience with various caching concepts.
