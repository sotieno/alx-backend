# i18n

Internationalization, often abbreviated as i18n (where 18 stands for the number of letters between 'i' and 'n' in the word 'internationalization'), is the process of designing and developing software applications that can be easily adapted to various languages, regions, and cultural preferences without the need for major code changes. Here, I create internationalized web pages with Flask.

## Learning Objectives
* How to parametrize Flask templates to display different languages
* How to infer the correct locale based on URL parameters, user settings or request headers
* How to localize timestamps
